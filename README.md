# Raceline
Code that calculates the minimum time in a specific raceline

The idea is to draw using WebPlotDigitizer or any other tool you like the points of a certain raceline of some track, and with that the code calculates the minumum achivable time, considering the torque of the engine, the air drag, weight of the driver, etc.
